    <p>A perfect date-night in meal with white bean gnocchi (made from pureed white beans and flour) topped with an easy cauliflower pan-sauce with chili flakes.</p>
    <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 20 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 25 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Total Time:</strong> 45 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Yield:</strong> 4 servings</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the gnocchi:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Cup white navy beans (drained and rinsed)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>1 Cup '00' tipo flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the cauliflower sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp minced shallots</li>
        <li>2 Cups cauliflower florets</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tsp. fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1/4 to 1/2 tsp. chili flakes</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup shredded parmesan</li>
        <li>Salt + pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor, combine the white beans in a food processor with 2 tablespoons of the reserved liquid. Puree, adding more liquid, until the white beans are smooth. Add in the egg and salt, pulsing until the egg is well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Continue to pulse and add ½ cup of flour. Add more flour as needed until the mixture forms a soft dough (the dough should still feel be tacky, just use more flour on your hands and surface). Place onto a surface covered in flour. Divide dough into three balls and roll each out into 1" ropes and cut gnocchi 1" at a time. </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Place half the gnocchi in the boiling water and let cook for 5-6 minutes. Gnocchi should be tender and cooked through. Spoon out the first batch and add the second half of the gnocchi. Cook until tender.</li>
        <li>While the gnocchi are cooking, make the cauliflower sauce. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the minced shallots and cauliflower to the pan. Cook until the cauliflower begins to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir only a couple times to ensure a nice caramelization. </li>
        <li>Once cauliflower is tender, reduce the heat to low and measure in the cream, thyme, and chili flakes. Simmer until the cream thickens slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the parmesan, salt, and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Divide the gnocchi into four bowls and top with extra thyme and chili flakes as desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p><strong>Tips & Tricks:</strong> Getting the right consistency for the gnocchi is key- extra flour means a denser bite. You want the dough to come together but still have a bit of stickiness to it.</p>
    <p>Look for vegetarian-friendly parmesan that uses microbial or vegetarian rennet.</p>
